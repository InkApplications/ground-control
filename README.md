Ground Control
==============

Ground control is a library that provides common utilities for synchronizing
local and remote data. It coordinates reactive callbacks from [RxJava] and
provides interfaces that can be used to create sane local SQLLite repositories
that stay in sync with the remote databases.

This project was designed with [Retrofit] and Android in mind, but they are
not required.
